## Challenges and Solutions
Didn't really encounter major challenges since I am already familiar with setting up environments. Some minor troubleshooting issues were easily solved through following the instructions from leons and quick google search. 

## Learning Outcomes
I was able to refresh my knowledge of setting up virtual environments in python. Development environments allow us to isolate packages for each project so it doesn't interfere with other projects, make our workplace cleaner/more organized, and it is safer to experiment here without affecting the global setup.
